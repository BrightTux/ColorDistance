# ColorDistance

Humans are able to identify basic colors easily, we can easily differentiate between red and blue, or green and yellow. But, how would a computer be able to do so? 

The codes in this repository helps users to measure the distance (or identify colors) based on a sample color-image.
In order to simplify the process, the source code used will loop through 960 different sample color-image, and measure the distance between the "ground truth" value and the sample color-image.
